# Deep Rock Galacic Based Battery Powered Light

## Notes
### Board Issues
- ESP8266 version must be `2.5.0`
- Can't be programmed from within platformio at the moment
  - Arduino must be used (sorry)


### Mechanical
1. Take the batteries out of the pack and house them in the square parts of the bumpers
2. Have the light change when set down on a base station
3. Have the battery holder / square bumper end cap screw on for easy access to the battery
4. Make an enclosure to go around the battery charger
5. Make a thing to go in the battery charger leaving the charger uneffected

### Functionality
1. Wiggle it and it goes dim
2. Shake it for light
3. Deep rock colour mode
4. Remote control mode control


### Battery used
* Bosch GBA
